# Description
In my first block of the Web Design Specialist course, I developed a captivating and interactive Tic-Tac-Toe game using JavaScript. This project showcases my foundational skills in web development, as I meticulously crafted the game's user interface and functionality. Players can engage in strategic battles, taking turns to mark their X or O on the grid, with the game determining the winner or declaring a draw. Through this project, I demonstrated my ability to manipulate the Document Object Model (DOM) to create a seamless and enjoyable user experience, a fundamental skill for any web designer.
